# Physics MCQ's Randomizer


Project Overview
The Physics MCQ Randomizer is a web-based application designed to generate randomized multiple-choice questions (MCQs) on physics topics. It is intended for students, educators, and institutions to create engaging quizzes, practice sessions, and assessments. This project demonstrates the effective use of backend processing, frontend interactivity, and modern web technologies to enhance the teaching and learning process.

Key Features
Randomized MCQs: Generates unique questions covering physics concepts like motion, forces, and energy.
Interactive User Interface: Allows users to select the number of questions and interact with quizzes seamlessly.
Real-Time Feedback: Provides instant scoring and detailed feedback on user performance.
Scalability: Supports the addition of new physics topics, difficulty levels, and customization options.
Responsive Design: Works across devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Technologies Used
Backend:

Python
Flask (web framework)
JSON (data storage and transfer)
Frontend:

HTML5
CSS3 (with Bootstrap for responsive design)
JavaScript and jQuery (for interactivity and AJAX)
Additional Tools:

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for linguistic processing in question generation.
Math library for physics calculations.
