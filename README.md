# Physics MCQ Randomizer - README

---

## Project Overview

The **Physics MCQ Randomizer** is a web-based application designed to generate randomized multiple-choice questions (MCQs) on physics topics. It is intended for students, educators, and institutions to create engaging quizzes, practice sessions, and assessments. This project demonstrates the effective use of backend processing, frontend interactivity, and modern web technologies to enhance the teaching and learning process.
